            Signed by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention on September 17, 1787, the United States Constitution established the nation's government, defined its fundamental laws, and guaranteed basic rights for its citizens. 
            <br><br>
            America’s first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, was ratified in 1781. The Articles served as a good blueprint for a young nation composed of loosely connected states that mostly operated independently. However, the national government at the time, the Congress of the Confederation, lacked authority over the states, and it was clear that, to maintain stability, the country needed a stronger centralized government.

            <br><br>
            That was why Congress invited delegates from all 13 states to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia to 'form a more perfect union' between the states. These delegates agreed on a plan for three branches of the national government—executive, legislative, and judicial—with a system of checks and balances to ensure that no single branch held too much power. Over time, amendments were made to the original Constitution to clarify rights and address the evolving needs of the country. These amendments, including the Bill of Rights, expanded protections for individual freedoms and adapted the Constitution to reflect new changes to make sure it remains a living document that is capable of guiding the nation.
