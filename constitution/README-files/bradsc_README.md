# Catherine Bradsher's README

In lab 1, I was responsible for amendments 17-27. I talk about the history,
court's interpretations, and my opinions of them. My sources are linked in text
or at the end of the sentences for which they are relevant, and are also at the
end of this file. I found the Constitution Center's "Interpretations" pages
helpful for many of the amendments, as they provide historical context and
arguments for and against each of them. I used information from them, other
sources, and my preexisting knowledge of history and contemporary politics in
my analysis. I did the markup for my analysis.

## Challenges

The main reason I got stuck on this assignment was the amount of work I had to
do in such a short time. Because my group prioritized our project proposal last
weekend, and due to our agreed upon meeting schedule, we did not agree on the
division of labor until Thursday 9/13. Although most of these amendments are
short, and I fully agreed to take them on, it was still a lot of writing to do
in one weekend. I think we need to get better at estimating how long
assignments will take, and should be more willing to break from our
Monday/Thursday meeting schedule when it makes sense.

I also recognize that I likely wrote more and in greater depth than was
strictly necessary for the assignment, and made it harder on myself. I
genuinely find this an interesting topic, and like sharing my opinions, but in
the future I should perhaps focus on meeting the base requirements first and
then adding on if I have time.
