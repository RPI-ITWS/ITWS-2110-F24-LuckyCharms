# README for Miranda Zheng (zhengm4)

In Lab 1, I created the inital commit with the basic css and outlines for each the pages. Our group decided to copy and paste the text of the Constitution into a json file and read the file using javascript for easier access, so in my inital commit, I also wrote the javascript and added the constitution.json file. I was also responsible for annotating articles 2 and 3. In these, I tried to summarize each section, giving fun-facts and historical reasoning where I could, and added a recap of the article's relevance today. I also wrote a quick "history" of the Constition and how the document came to be for the landing page.

## Challenges

Deciding what the web app would look like proved to be a challenge, but as I looked around at other Constitution sites, I really liked how simple the [National Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution) site was and wanted the group's site to be something similar. A lot of the web design inspiration was taken from the National Constitution Center site.

Figuring out how to read from the json file using javascript proved to be a challenge at first since I was still refreshing myself on how to do javascript after a little while away. After searching up and finding an article from GeeksforGeeks, I ended up figuring things out.

Another challenge was working through the Constitution itself. Since it was written so long ago, some of the old-english wording is hard to understand. With the help of the Constitution center's "Interpretation" section for seach article, I was able to understand what was written.
