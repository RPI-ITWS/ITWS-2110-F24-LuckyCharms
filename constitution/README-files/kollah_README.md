# Heman S. Kolla (kollah) README

## What I Did

- Completed all setup for the VM.
- Worked with Billy Wu to consolidate numerous html files into few index.html files that use JS to load text & analysis.
- Added analysis to my share of sections (Articles IV - VII & Preamble).
- Completed this README.

## Additional Notes

- One Helpful Thing: I had a better team than I was expecting. We worked effiiently asynchronously.
- One Challenging Thing: Nothing was particularly difficult; this was review.
- One "To-Change" Thing: An analysis.json file would be nice. This would clearly distinguish what is part of the Constitution and what is part of our annotations.
