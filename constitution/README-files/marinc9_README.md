# README for Christian Marinkovich

This is the README file for Chritian Marinkovich.

## Work I did for this lab:

* The first thing that I did was meet with everyone to plan out how we are going to break down this lab in terms of workload and how we will organize it.
* I helped format and fix some of the bugs of the amendment landing pages.
* I worked on the analysis for amendments 1-10 and helped incorperate it onto the website.
* I made sure that the analysis looked correct and that there was no anomolies in the website code (Such as outdates functions highlighted red)
