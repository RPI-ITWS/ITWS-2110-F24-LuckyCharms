Billy Wu's Read ME:

After the initial commit, I noticed there were too many html files and a lot of the html had a similar format so I replaced it with just one index.html file for both the consitution and ammendments. After that came my assigned ammendments, 11-16. The long ones, amendments 12, and 14 are the hardest ones to parse so naturally I had to look for sources making it easier to understand it. Other ones are also hard to understand without proper context for its time period, so I had to include that in my analysis.
